## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Discount Calculator Logic**
```javascript
// Primary discount calculation
discountAmount = (originalPrice √ó discountPercent) / 100
priceAfterFirstDiscount = originalPrice - discountAmount

// Additional discount (on already discounted price)
additionalDiscountAmount = (priceAfterFirstDiscount √ó additionalDiscount) / 100
priceAfterAllDiscounts = priceAfterFirstDiscount - additionalDiscountAmount

// Tax calculation (on discounted price)
taxAmount = (priceAfterAllDiscounts √ó taxPercent) / 100
finalPrice = priceAfterAllDiscounts + taxAmount

// Total savings calculation
totalSavings = originalPrice - priceAfterAllDiscounts
savingsPercent = (totalSavings / originalPrice) √ó 100
```

### **Fuel Cost Calculator Logic**
```javascript
// Basic cost calculation
costPerKm = fuelPrice / mileage

// Daily/Monthly cost calculation
if (dailyDistance) {
  dailyCost = dailyDistance √ó costPerKm
  monthlyCost = dailyCost √ó 30
} else if (monthlyDistance) {
  monthlyCost = monthlyDistance √ó costPerKm
  dailyCost = monthlyCost / 30
}

// Extended calculations
weeklyCost = dailyCost √ó 7
yearlyCost = monthlyCost √ó 12
fuelConsumption = distance / mileage
```
