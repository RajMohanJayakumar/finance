# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the FinClamp Financial Calculator to various hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy

### Netlify (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. The `_redirects` file will automatically handle SPA routing

### Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Output directory: `dist`
4. The `vercel.json` file will handle SPA routing

### GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Use GitHub Actions for deployment:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

## üîß Configuration Files

### For Netlify
- `public/_redirects` - Handles SPA routing
- Automatically included in build

### For Vercel

- `/games?in=finance-quest` - Finance Game
- Legacy: `/?calculator=emi&category=loans`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Page Not Found" on Direct URL Access
- Ensure your hosting platform serves `index.html` for all routes
- Check that the appropriate config file is deployed:

  - Vercel: `vercel.json`
  - Apache: `.htaccess`

### Build Errors
- Run `npm ci` to ensure clean dependencies
- Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
- Verify all environment variables are set

### Performance Issues
